<p>This Transformers movie was definitely one of My most anticipated Movies of all time , I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it, The story , The action , The animation , Everything about this particular movie was out of this world </p>
    
    <img src = "Avengers.jpg" alt = "Assemble The Team " height = "200px " width = "200px ">
<p>This Marvel Blockbuster was Totally worth the watch and time I loved the build up to this movie and learning about each heroes backstory and skills they had to offer</p>
    
    <img src = "Arrow%205.jpg" alt = " One of The Best Seasons ever" height = "200px " width = "200px ">

<p>Star Wars episode 3 will always be my favorite in that it was the most action packed out of all 3 of the prequel movies , I also liked how it tied in to the original trilogy</p>
